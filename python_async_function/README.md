# async and await syntax:

Explanation:

The async and await keywords are used in Python to work with asynchronous code. async is used to define a coroutine, **which is a special type of function that can be paused and resumed.** await is used inside a coroutine to pause execution until a coroutine or task completes.

## **How to execute an async program with asyncio:**

Explanation:

To execute an async program, you typically use the asyncio.run() function, passing in the main coroutine that you want to run.

Example: python
```
import asyncio

async def main():
    # Your async code here
    print("Welcome to Python Notes!")


# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     asyncio.run(main())
```

## **How to run concurrent coroutines:**

Explanation:

 You can run multiple coroutines concurrently using asyncio.gather() or by creating tasks with asyncio.create_task().

Example: python

```
import asyncio

async def coroutine1():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Coroutine 1 finished")

async def coroutine2():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    print("Coroutine 2 finished")

async def main():
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(coroutine1())
    task2 = asyncio.create_task(coroutine2())
    await asyncio.gather(task1, task2)

# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     asyncio.run(main())
```

## **How to create asyncio tasks:**

Explanation:

You can create asyncio tasks using the asyncio.create_task() function, which allows you to schedule coroutines to run concurrently.

Example: python
```
import asyncio

async def my_coroutine():
    # Your coroutine code here
    print("Hey There, friend!")

async def main():
    task = asyncio.create_task(my_coroutine())
    await task

# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     asyncio.run(main())
```

## How to use the random module:
---
Explanation:

The random module in Python is used to generate random numbers and make random choices. You can use it for various tasks, such as simulating randomness in your applications.

Example: python
```
import random

random_number = random.randint(1, 10)
print("Random number:", random_number)

random_choice = random.choice(["apple", "banana", "cherry"])
print("Random choice:", random_choice)
```
