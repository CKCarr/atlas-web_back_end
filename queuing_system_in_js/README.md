## Running a Redis Server on Your Machine

1. Download and Install Redis:

- Visit the Redis official website or use package managers like Homebrew (for macOS) or apt-get (for Ubuntu) to install Redis on your machine.

2. Start Redis Server:

- Once installed, start the Redis server using the command `redis-server`. This will start the Redis server on the default port 6379.

## Running Simple Operations with the Redis Client

1. Install Redis Client for Node.js:

- Use npm to install the Redis client for Node.js. You can do this by running `npm install redis` in your terminal.

2. Connect to Redis Server:

- In your Node.js application, require the Redis client module and connect to the Redis server using the default port and host (localhost:6379).

3. Perform Operations:

- Use the Redis client methods like `set`, `get`, `hset`, `hget`, etc., to perform simple operations like setting and getting key-value pairs, storing hash values, etc.

## Dealing with Async Operations with Redis

- Understanding Callbacks/Promises:
Since Redis operations are asynchronous, make sure to handle callbacks or promises to deal with the results of these operations.

## Using Kue as a Queue System

1. Install Kue:

- Use npm to install Kue in your Node.js application: `npm install kue`.

2. Create a Queue:

- Set up a Kue queue by requiring the Kue module and creating a new queue instance.

3. Add Jobs to the Queue:

- Use queue.create() method to add jobs to the queue with necessary data and processing function.

4. Process Jobs:

- Define worker functions to process jobs added to the queue. These functions will be executed when jobs are dequeued.

## Building a Basic Express App Interacting with Redis Server

1. Install Express and Redis Modules:

- Use npm to install Express and Redis modules: `npm install express redis`.

2. Set up Express App:

- Create an Express application and configure routes to interact with Redis for basic operations like setting, getting data, etc.

3. Handle Async Operations:

- Use async/await or promises to handle asynchronous Redis operations within your Express routes.

## Building a Basic Express App Interacting with Redis Server and Queue

1. Integrate Kue with Express:

- Set up Kue within your Express application by creating endpoints to add jobs to the queue and process them.

2. Define Routes for Queue Interaction:

- Create routes for adding jobs to the queue and monitoring job status.

3. Process Queue Jobs:

- Define worker functions to process queued jobs within your Express application.
