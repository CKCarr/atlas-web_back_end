# The Difference Between Unit and Integration Tests
## Unit Tests
Unit tests are the foundation of a solid testing pyramid. They focus on testing the smallest parts of an application in isolation (typically individual functions or methods).

### Key Characteristics of Unit Tests:

- **Isolation:**
 They test a 'unit' in isolation, meaning external systems like databases or web services are not involved.
- __Speed:__ They are fast because they test something small and don't rely on external systems.
- **Precision:** They pinpoint exactly where a problem is when they fail because they cover a small piece of code.
- __Mocking:__ External dependencies (like database calls, file I/O) are often replaced with mocks or stubs, ensuring the unit test only focuses on the code it is meant to test.

## Integration Tests
Integration tests verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together. It's a test of the cohesiveness of your application components.

### Key Characteristics of Integration Tests:

- __Combination:__ They test the interaction between multiple units, verifying that they work together as expected.
- __Slower:__ They are slower than unit tests as they test integrations with external systems and services.
- __Complexity:__ They can be more complex and harder to set up, requiring the configuration of the different components being tested.
- __Mocks:__ While some low-level functions (like an API call to a third-party service) might still be mocked to avoid unpredictable behavior, many real components are used.

## Testing Patterns
1. __Mocking__

  Mocking is a powerful pattern in testing, especially for unit tests. It allows you to replace real objects with mock objects and make assertions about how they have been used.

  - __When to use:__

      When you want to test a unit in isolation, without actually invoking external services or methods.
  - __Benefits:__

      Faster tests, more focused on the unit under test, avoiding side effects from external systems.
  - __Tools:__

      Python's unittest.mock is a common way to create mocks.
2. __Parametrization__

  Parametrization involves running the same test with different inputs. It helps in covering a broader set of scenarios for your tests, ensuring your code works correctly with various inputs.

  - __When to use:__

      When you have a function that should behave similarly across an array of different inputs.
  - __Benefits:__

      Reduces code duplication, increases the robustness of your tests.
  - __Tools:__
      Libraries like pytest offer easy parametrization of tests.

3. __Fixtures__

  Fixtures are a way of providing a fixed baseline upon which tests can reliably and repeatedly execute. They set up the prerequisites for tests but are not part of the test itself.

  - __When to use:__

      When you have some setup code that needs to run before several tests, not just one.
  - __Benefits:__

      DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself), cleaner test code, and fixtures can use resources efficiently (like setting up a database connection that can be reused).
  - __Tools:__

      Both unittest and pytest have support for fixtures.
